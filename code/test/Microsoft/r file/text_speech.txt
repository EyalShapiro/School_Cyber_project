In October 2019, Dr. Woodie Flowers, an innovator in design and engineering education and a
Distinguished Advisor to FIRST and supporter of our mission, passed away. As thousands of heartfelt
tributes to Woodie have poured in from around the world, it is clear his legacy will live on indefinitely
through the gracious nature of our community and our ongoing commitment to empowering educators
and building global citizens.
